## General info

This little game I've created as a small birthday gift to my brother, who likes Assassin's Creed game series. It's written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and uses jQuery, media queries for mobile devices. The custom screenshots for the cards are made by me. The original project is based on the idea present in the JavaScript course from Pasja Informatyki ( [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edNqTubHUU0) ) however I improved it's look, added transition effects, and rewritten the code to include more features, get rid of bugs, and be less redundant. Features random array shuffling using the Fisher-Yates algorithm in pure JavaScript - [Link](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/). Runs even on IE11.
